lib/cdk-workshop-stack.ts is where your CDK application’s main stack is defined. This is the file we’ll be spending most of our time in.
bin/cdk-workshop.ts is the entrypoint of the CDK application. It will load the stack defined in lib/cdk-workshop-stack.ts.
package.json is your npm module manifest. It includes information like the name of your app, version, dependencies and build scripts like “watch” and “build” (package-lock.json is maintained by npm)
cdk.json tells the toolkit how to run your app. In our case it will be "npx ts-node bin/cdk-workshop.ts"
tsconfig.json your project’s typescript configuration
.gitignore and .npmignore tell git and npm which files to include/exclude from source control and when publishing this module to the package manager.
node_modules is maintained by npm and includes all your project’s dependencies.

tracking changes
TS CDK projects created with cdk init ignore all .js files by default. To track these files with git, add !lambda/*.js to your .gitignore file. This ensures that your Lambda assets are discoverable during the Pipelines section of this tutorial.
